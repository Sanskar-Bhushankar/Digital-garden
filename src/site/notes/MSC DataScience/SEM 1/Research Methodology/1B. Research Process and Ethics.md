### Research Process Steps

1. **Identify the Problem**
    
    - Begin by finding an issue or research question.
    - A clearly defined problem guides the entire research process.
    - Methods to identify the problem:
        - Preliminary surveys
        - Case studies
        - Interviews with a small group
        - Observational surveys
2. **Evaluate the Literature**
    
    - Review relevant studies to understand the background of your problem.
    - Helps identify gaps in knowledge and areas that need further research.
    - Provides consistency by connecting your work with existing research.
    - Helps in understanding how previous studies were conducted and their conclusions.
3. **Create Hypotheses**
    
    - Formulate an original hypothesis based on the research topic.
    - A hypothesis proposes a relationship between variables.
    - It provides focus and direction for the research.
4. **The Research Design**
    
    - Plan for how to achieve the research objectives and answer the research questions.
    - Helps decide how to gather the relevant information.
    - Types of research designs:
        - Exploration and Surveys
        - Experiments
        - Data Analysis
        - Observations
5. **Describe Population**
    
    - Identify the specific group or population to study.
    - The population could be a specific age group, gender, location, or ethnicity.
    - Defining the sample ensures the results can be generalized.
6. **Data Collection**
    
    - Gather the necessary data to answer the research question.
    - Data can be primary (collected directly from sources) or secondary (already available).
    - Methods of data collection:
        - Experiments
        - Questionnaires
        - Observations
        - Interviews
    - Secondary data sources:
        - Literature reviews
        - Official/unofficial reports
        - Library resources
7. **Data Analysis**
    
    - After collecting data, analyze it using the methods planned during the design phase.
    - Data is categorized, coded, and tabulated for statistical analysis.
    - The goal is to identify patterns and draw conclusions from the data.
8. **Report Writing**
    
    - Prepare a report to communicate the research findings.
    - Components of the report:
        - **Layout**: Includes title, date, acknowledgments, preface, and a table of contents.
        - **Introduction**: States the purpose and methods of the research.
        - **Summary of Findings**: A brief, non-technical summary of the results.
        - **Principal Report**: Main body, broken into sections for clarity.
        - **Conclusion**: Restates findings and summarizes the final results.

# **Guidelines for Formulating Research Questions and Objectives**:
Here’s a concise answer for **Guidelines for Formulating Research Questions and Objectives** (5 marks):

### **Guidelines for Formulating Research Questions**:
1. **Clarity**:      
    - The question should be easy to understand and clearly defined.
    - Avoid vague terms; be as specific as possible to focus the research.
2. **Feasible**
    
    - Ensure the question can be answered within the available time and resources.
    - Consider the methods and tools needed for data collection and analysis.
3. **Relevant**
    
    - The question should address a significant issue in the field of study.
    - It should contribute to existing knowledge or solve real-world problems.
4. **Researchable**
    
    - The question must be answerable through data collection and analysis.
    - It should be based on observable or measurable variables.
5. **Open-Ended**
    
    - Frame the question to allow for exploration and detailed answers.
    - Avoid yes/no questions; instead, ask questions that promote in-depth investigation.

### Guidelines for Formulating Research Objectives(goal)

1. **Clear and Specific**
    
    - The objectives should be precisely defined, focusing on a specific aspect of the research topic.
    - Avoid general or broad objectives that could lead to confusion.
2. **Achievable**
    
    - Ensure the objectives are realistic and can be accomplished within the given timeframe and resources.
    - Consider the scope of the research and its limitations.
3. **Measurable**
    
    - The objectives should be measurable so that progress can be tracked and outcomes can be assessed.
    - Use clear criteria or indicators to evaluate success.
4. **Relevant**
    
    - Ensure the objectives align with the purpose of the research and contribute to answering the research question.
    - They should be important to the field of study and address real problems.
5. **Focused and Concise**
    
    - Keep objectives focused on the key aspects of the research.
    - They should be brief and to the point, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
6. **Action-Oriented**
    
    - Use action verbs (e.g., analyze, evaluate, compare) to describe the steps needed to achieve the objectives.
    - This helps clarify what needs to be done in the research process.
### **Examples**:
- **Research Question**: How does social media usage affect the mental health of teenagers?  
- **Research Objective**: To analyze the relationship between social media usage and anxiety levels among teenagers aged 13–18.
