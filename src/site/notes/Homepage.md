## Hi, I'm Sanskar Bhushankar

This is my resources and notes sharing platform where I share my notes, ideas, and thoughts that I write.

I am a bit of a writer-philosopher of my own, and here I document the world through my eyes.

I am a **digital craftsman**, building my own version of the digital world, one step at a time.
