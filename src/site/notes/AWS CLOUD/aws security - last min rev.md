## Types of firewall in EC2

In EC2, there are two main types of firewalls:

1. **Security Groups**: Act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. They are stateful, meaning if you allow inbound traffic, the response is automatically allowed.
2. **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**: Operate at the subnet level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic for all instances within a subnet. They are stateless, meaning responses must be explicitly allowed.

### WHICH THREE TASKS ARE PERFORMED AT THE PREVENTION PHASE OF SECURITY LIFE CYCLE

- Identify assets to be protected
- Assess  asset vulnerability
- implement countermeasures

---
# Network Hardening
- **Prevents** unauthorized access, misuse, and data breaches.
- **Two Types**:
    - **Discovery Hardening** â€“ Blocks network mapping.
    - **Architecture Hardening** â€“ Secures design.
#### **Threats & Prevention**

- **Network Mapping** (ping, traceroute, Nmap) â€“ **Disable ICMP, SNMP**.
- **Port Scanning** (Nmap) â€“ **Monitor & limit access**.
- **Traffic Sniffing** (Wireshark) â€“ **Encrypt data, use switches**.
- **AWS:** Use **Amazon Inspector** for vulnerabilities.
#### **Architecture Hardening**

- **Firewalls** â€“ Deny all by default.
- **IPS** â€“ Blocks threats (**AWS Network Firewall**).
- **Segmentation** â€“ Uses **CIDR & ACLs** for subnet security.
#### **AWS Security**

- **Security Groups** â€“ Instance-level, **stateful**.
- **Network ACLs** â€“ Subnet-level, **stateless**.
- **Layered** security for VPCs.

ðŸ”¹ **Focus**: Block threats, encrypt data, limit access, monitor traffic.
1. **AWS Systems Manager**: Focused on managing and automating tasks on AWS resources (e.g., patching, inventory, secure shell access).
2. **Amazon CloudWatch**: Provides real-time monitoring of AWS resources and applications (e.g., performance metrics and logs).
3. **AWS CloudTrail**: Tracks all API and console actions in AWS for auditing and compliance.

**Key Difference**:
- Systems Manager = Manage resources.
- CloudWatch = Monitor resources.
- CloudTrail = Track actions on resources.

# System hardening

- **Goal**: Secure systems by reducing vulnerabilities while balancing usability and productivity.
- **Core Principles**: Focus on **authentication**, **authorization**, and **accounting**.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Disable unnecessary services.
  - Apply patches and updates regularly.
  - Establish **security baselines** to detect anomalies.
  - Use group policies for centralized control.

![](/img/user/AWS CLOUD/attachments/Pasted image 20250202190751.png)

- **Types of Hardening**:
  - **Server Hardening**: Secure data, ports, and permissions.
  - **Application Hardening**: Update security measures for standard and third-party apps.
  - **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**: Secure BYOD environments.
  `For securing mobile devices, use a mobile device management (MDM) solution. Use MDM to enforce corporate and security policies regarding the use of devices. Companies that permit bring your own device (BYOD) should implement MDM`
- **Physical Security**: Restrict access, use surveillance, and design disaster-resistant facilities.
- **AWS Tools**:
  - **Trusted Advisor**: Best practice recommendations.
  - **GuardDuty**: Threat detection using machine learning.
  - **Shield**: DDoS protection.
  - **CloudTrail**: Tracks user activity for auditing.
- **Training**: Educate employees to combat social engineering and phishing.
- **Key Takeaway**: Harden systems by minimizing attack surfaces, applying patches, and using tools like AWS for automated security management.

# PREVENTION - DATA SECURITY

**CIA Triad:** **Confidentiality** (protect data), **Integrity** (prevent tampering), **Availability** (ensure access).
### **Encryption**

- **Symmetric:** Same key for encryption & decryption. **Fast, used for large data (AES, IDEA, Twofish)**.
- **Asymmetric:** Public & private key pair. **More secure, slower (RSA, DH, ElGamal)**.
- **Hybrid:** Uses asymmetric for key exchange, symmetric for bulk data (TLS, secure messaging).
### **AWS Encryption Services**

- **CloudHSM:** Hardware security module for key management & compliance.
- **AWS KMS:** Fully managed cryptographic key service, integrates with AWS.

---
# PREVENTION - PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE

Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a collection of technologies that are used to apply cryptography principles to transfer information securely between two entities. It is based on a practical distribution and implementation of keys, with a set of tools to achieve confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, and authenticity

![](/img/user/AWS CLOUD/attachments/Pasted image 20250202193157.png)


**Components:**
- **Certificate Authority (CA):** Issues and manages digital certificates.
- **Registration Authority (RA):** Verifies certificate requests before CA approval.
- **Certificate Revocation List (CRL):** A list of revoked certificates.
- **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):** Used to check if a certificate is revoked in real time.
- **Certificates:** Digital IDs proving ownership of public keys.

**How it Works:** A user requests a certificate from RA, which passes it to CA. After verification, CA issues the certificate.

==**ACM - AWS Certificate Manager :** A service to manage certificates for AWS services, simplifying their use and renewal.==

# PREVENTION - IDENTITY MANAGEMENT

**AAA Principles:**
    - **Authentication:** Verifying identity (e.g., password, ID).
    - **Authorization:** Granting access based on identity.
    - **Accounting:** Tracking user actions (e.g., login logs).

 ==**AWS Identity Management Services:**==
    - **AWS SSO:** Centralizes SSO access to AWS accounts.
    - **Amazon Cognito:** Manages user authentication for apps.
    - **AWS IAM:** Controls access to AWS resources using policies.

---

# 4. PREVENTION - IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT (AWS)

- **IAM Overview**: Manages access to AWS resources (authentication and authorization). Itâ€™s free and global.
- **Components**:
    - **Users**: Person/application with credentials and permissions.
    - **Groups**: Collections of users for easier permission management.
    - **Roles**: Provide temporary access to resources and avoid long-term credentials.
- **Security Credentials**: Includes IAM username/password, access keys, MFA, and key pairs. Avoid using root for daily tasks, enable MFA for extra security.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: IAM policies define resource access and actions; explicit deny takes precedence.
- **IAM Policies**:
    - **Managed Policies**: Standalone policies.
    - **Inline Policies**: Embedded into a user/group/role.
    - **Access Control**: Actions are denied by default, with policies allowing or denying access.
- **Access to AWS Services**: Access AWS services through Console, CLI, SDKs, and APIs.
