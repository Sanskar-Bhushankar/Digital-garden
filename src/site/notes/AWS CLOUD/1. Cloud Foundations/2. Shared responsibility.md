#### **Key Concepts**

- **Shared Responsibility Model**:
    - AWS and customers both play a role in cloud security.
    - **AWS's Role**: Responsible for the security _of_ the cloud infrastructure.
    - **Customer's Role**: Responsible for security _in_ the cloud (their data, apps, settings, etc.).

#### **AWS Responsibilities (Security OF the Cloud)**

- **Physical Security**:
    - Secures data centers (guards, surveillance, access control).
- **Infrastructure Security**:
    - Hardware (servers, storage) & Software Infrastructure.
    - Network (routers, switches, firewalls).
    - Virtualization layer (instance isolation).
- **Compliance**:
    - AWS handles compliance certifications and audits for infrastructure.

#### **Customer Responsibilities (Security IN the Cloud)**

- **Data and Content Management**:
    - Data storage choices, encryption, and access permissions.
- **Application and OS Security**:
    - Patching, updates, and configuration of applications using correct os flavous if using their own OS.
- **Network Security**:
    - Security groups, firewalls, and network configurations.
- **Account and Access Management**:
    - User permissions, IAM roles, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### **Service Models & Responsibilities**

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
    - Examples: Amazon EC2, Amazon VPC.
    - **Customer Responsibility**: Full control over guest OS, security groups, network settings, storage.
    - **AWS Responsibility**: Physical infrastructure and virtualization layer.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
    - Examples: AWS Lambda, Amazon RDS.
    - **Customer Responsibility**: Focus on data, permissions, and applications.
    - **AWS Responsibility**: Underlying OS, patching, security configurations, disaster recovery.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
    - Examples: AWS Trusted Advisor, AWS Shield, Amazon Chime.
    - **Customer Responsibility**: Minimal, mainly access control.
    - **AWS Responsibility**: Full stack management (hardware, software, and application).

#### **Activity Scenarios (Responsibility Examples) MCQ **

- **EC2 Instance OS Patching**: Customer's responsibility.
- **Physical Data Center Security**: AWS's responsibility.
- **Virtualization Infrastructure**: AWS's responsibility.
- **Security Group Configuration on EC2**: Customer's responsibility.
- **Application Configuration on EC2**: Customer's responsibility.
- **S3 Bucket Access**: Customerâ€™s responsibility.
