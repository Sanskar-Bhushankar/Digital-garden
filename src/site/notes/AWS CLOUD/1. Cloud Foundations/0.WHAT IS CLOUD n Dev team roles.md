# what is cloud computing

on demand delivery of compute services
servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”)
**Traditional Model** relies on owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, while the **Cloud Model** delivers scalable, on-demand resources over the internet, eliminating the need for physical hardware ownership.

### **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**:
- **Explanation**: Provides basic infrastructure (virtual machines, storage), and you manage everything else.
- **Analogy**: Like driving your own car—full control but you manage everything yourself.

### **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**:
- **Explanation**: Offers a platform to build and manage applications without managing infrastructure.
- **Analogy**: Like taking a cab—no worries about fuel or the route, but you follow the driver’s path.

### **SaaS (Software as a Service)**:
- **Explanation**: Provides fully functional software over the internet with no maintenance needed.
- **Analogy**: Like a guided tour—everything is taken care of for you, you just enjoy the ride.

    - They run these tests, investigate any failures, document steps to reproduce bugs, and assist in defining acceptance criteria.
- **Software Developer:**
