#### **1. Types of Networks**

- **LAN:** Local connections; high-speed Ethernet or wireless.
- **WAN:** Links over large areas using fiber optics or satellites (e.g., internet).

#### **2. Network Topologies**

- **Physical:**
    - **Bus:** Simple; single cable, prone to collisions.
    - **Star:** Central switch; better performance.
    - **Mesh:** Redundant connections; costly.
    - **Hybrid:** Combines topologies (e.g., star-bus).
    - **VPC Topology:** A virtual network on AWS offering isolation and configurability.

#### 3. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
A VPC enables users to establish a private, virtual network on the AWS platform.12 It offers isolation and customisability, resembling a traditional network within a data centre

## Comparison of LAN, WAN and VPC

|Feature|LAN|WAN|VPC|
|---|---|---|---|
|Definition|A network that connects devices in a limited geographical area, such as a floor, building or campus.|A network that connects devices over a large geographical area, such as multiple cities or countries.|A virtual network that allows users to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated space.|
|Geographical Span|Limited, typically within a single site.|Wide, spanning across cities, countries or continents.|Can span multiple regions within AWS, which are geographically dispersed.|
|Connectivity|Typically uses Ethernet cables or wireless technology.|Uses technologies like fibre-optic cables, satellites and leased lines.|Uses virtual networking constructs within the AWS cloud infrastructure.|
|Speed|Usually offers high data transfer rates due to shorter distances.|Can have varying speeds depending on the technology used; generally slower than LANs due to greater distances.|Can achieve high speeds within the AWS network, but inter-region communication might have higher latency.|
|Management|Usually managed by a single organisation.|Can be managed by multiple organisations or service providers.|Managed by the user within the AWS environment.|
|Cost|Relatively inexpensive to set up and maintain.|Can be expensive to set up and maintain due to the infrastructure required.|Costs depend on the resources used and configured within the VPC.|
|Examples|Home network, office network, school network.|The internet, corporate networks connecting multiple branches.|A virtual network for hosting web servers, databases and other applications within AWS.|
|Similarities to Traditional Network Concepts|Resembles a traditional LAN in terms of its limited scope and use of technologies like Ethernet.|Can be compared to a traditional WAN in its ability to connect geographically dispersed locations.|Shares similarities with traditional network concepts of isolation, segmentation and security through constructs like subnets and security groups.|


#### VPC Peering 
**VPC Peering** allows private communication between two Amazon VPCs, enabling resource sharing. It connects VPCs across different AWS regions, similar to how a WAN links remote offices. Peering creates a private link, allowing traffic to flow directly between VPCs without going over the public internet. This method ensures secure, reliable connectivity between geographically dispersed networks in AWS.

#### 4. **Network Management Models:**

- **Client-Server Model:** A central server manages and distributes data to clients; if the server fails, clients lose access.
- **Peer-to-Peer Model:** Each node manages its own data and resources; tasks are shared directly between peers without a central server. Security is less restrictive, and it’s suitable for small networks.
- This model might be considered under the following conditions: 
	-  Users are responsible for backing up each node.
	-  Security requirements are not restrictive. • A limited number of peers are used.
