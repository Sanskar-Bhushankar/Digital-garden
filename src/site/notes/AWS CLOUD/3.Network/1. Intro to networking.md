> [!NOTE] Last minute revison
> 1. A computer network is collection of logically connected computing devices to communicate and share resources
> 2. there is a node and a host nodes are the computers or devices and hosts are the devices with specials functions also called as servers 
> 3. A computer network consists of nodes(devices),cables, routers, switches, Network interface cards NIC 
> 4. NIC connects the device to a network (cable) and switches connet multiple devices to a network ,Nic has its own Mac address
> 5. OSI  model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network ** Physical, DataLink, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application**
> 6. Client is a device which makes request, server is a device which Responds request
> 7. Network cables connect devices, a switch forwards network traffic, a router connects and filter networks and packets, and a modem provides internet access.
> 8. A router can filter traffic and switch can only switch traffic
> 9. peering connects 2 vpc like man 
> 10. connectionless protocol means no direct connect between client server ,server sends msg anyone can process example UDP

- **Internet origin:**
    - Developed from packet-switching theory and TCP/IP.
- **Computer networking analogy:**
    - A highway system connecting devices; data travels from point A to B like cars on roads.
- **Computer network definition:**
    - A group of connected devices (nodes) sharing resources and communication.
- **Node and host:**    
    - **Node:** Any device on a network (e.g., computer, router, printer).
    - **Host:** A node with a specific function (e.g., server).
- **Basic network structure:**

	- Computers → Network Interface Cards (NICs) → Connected to a switch → Connected to a router.
- **Data in computing:**
    - Consists of bits and bytes (0s and 1s).
    - Data types include character, text, numbers, and media.
    - Can be transmitted across networks or stored.


## OSI Model 

The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how data is transferred over a network.

#### **1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)**

- **Purpose:** Responsible for transmitting raw bitstreams (0s and 1s) over a physical medium.
- **Functions:**
    - Defines hardware specifications like cables, switches, and connectors.
    - Manages voltage levels, data rates, and physical connection methods.
- **Examples:** Ethernet cables, fiber optics, hubs, and repeaters.

#### **2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**

- **Purpose:** Provides error detection and ensures reliable transmission over the physical link.
- **Functions:**
    - Frames data (adds start/end delimiters).
    - Uses MAC addresses for device identification.
    - Handles error correction and flow control.
- **Examples:** Switches, Network Interface Cards (NICs), protocols like Ethernet and PPP.

#### **3. Network Layer (Layer 3)**

- **Purpose:** Determines the best path for data to travel across networks.
- **Functions:**
    - Manages logical addressing (IP addresses).
    - Routes data packets between devices across different networks.
    - Handles congestion control and error detection for packets.
- **Examples:** Routers, IPv4, IPv6.

#### **4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)**

- **Purpose:** Ensures reliable delivery of data end-to-end.
- **Functions:**
    - Provides error recovery and flow control.
    - Manages segmentation and reassembly of data.
    - Uses protocols like TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP (connectionless).
- **Examples:** TCP, UDP, port numbers.

#### **5. Session Layer (Layer 5)**

- **Purpose:** Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications.
- **Functions:**
    - Maintains session synchronization.
    - Manages data exchange between applications.
    - Ensures that multiple streams of data don't mix.
- **Examples:** APIs, remote procedure calls (RPCs).

#### **6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**

- **Purpose:** Ensures that data is in a readable and transferable format.
- **Functions:**
    - Handles data translation, encryption, and compression.
    - Converts data between application and network formats.
- **Examples:** SSL/TLS encryption, JPEG, GIF, ASCII.

#### **7. Application Layer (Layer 7)**

- **Purpose:** Provides network services to applications and end-users.
- **Functions:**
    - Supports protocols for file transfers, email, and web browsing.
    - Acts as an interface between the user and the network.
- **Examples:** HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.


### Network devices

- **Network cables, including fibre-optic, coaxial, and twisted-pair, physically link devices within a network.**
- **A switch uses MAC addresses to direct traffic between devices on the same network.**
- **A router connects multiple networks and uses IP addresses to manage data flow between them.**
- **A modem acts as a bridge between a home network and the internet, facilitating communication with the internet service provider (ISP).**


==What can a router do that a switch cannot?== 
A router can filter traffic, while a switch can only switch traffic. 

==What does a network interface card (NIC) use that is known as a unique physical identifier given by the manufacturer?== 
A media access control (MAC) address.
